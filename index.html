							<h2>Education</h2>
							<header>
								<h3>Diploma in IT & Systems Engineering</h3>
								<p>2013 / 2018</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Started with a Science path in High School, 
								then decided to take a crazy leap at the end of my third year and moved into year 4 of IT and Systems Engineering, 
								where I did more programming and generally better satisfied my passion for technology. It was a crazy feat that everyone discouraged 
								but I pulled it off, graduating with an excellent score that gave me access to one of the highest rated universities for Game Development.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Games Design and Programming</h3>
								<p>2018 / 2021 - <strong>First Class</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p>
								I graduated "First Class” from Staffordshire University, 
								with a Final Year Project on an “Inclusive Co-op Dialogue System” for multiplayer games (93% mark!). 
								The Dialog System was just one of many games and tools that I developed using Unity, Unreal Engine, 
								and a variety of other programs covering all aspects of Game Development: from Programming to 3D Modelling and Animation, Sound, Game Design...
							</p>
							<h2>Experience</h2>
							<header>
								<h3>Technical QA Tester, Larian Studios</h3>
								<p>2021 / Today</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								In my time at Larian Studios, I have been performing quality assurance on impending highly technical changes relating to the Editor, 
								Engine, and Gameplay Systems, working on documentation for tools and workflows, 
								and building and contributing to automated solutions employed by our own team.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Hammerheart, Indie Game Developer</h3>
								<p>2019 / 2021</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								I jumped on the ship that was Hammerheart on its second year of development, and at a tough time. 
								The game needed an identity and help to get to Steam Early Access: I re-designed the Combat System, AI, and other game systems, 
								built the Dialog System and other internal development tools, 
								and developed the game with my dear friend Bennett until it made it to Steam Early Access, 
								where the reviews have been very positive since. A personal satisfaction: so many good words on the Combat System!
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Individual Games Technology Project, Staffordshire University</h3>
								<p>2018 / 2021</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Explored new and exciting horizons with my Inclusive Co-op Dialogue System, 
								through heavy researching and polishing. Have been planning of re-building it from scratch, 
								making use of Unity’s GraphView APIs to build a graph based dialogue editor to go alongside it.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Global Game Jam</h3>
								<p>2020 / 2021</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Have been through the chaos and fun of working as part of a team of 4 during the 2020 Global Game Jam, and a team of 6 during the 2021 edition. More!
