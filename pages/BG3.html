							<h2>Baldur's Gate 3</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I worked on one of the most ambitious RPGs of all time, as part of the biggest indipendent game development studio in the world.
							During my time as a Technical QA Tester at Larian, I have performed quality assurance on impending highly technical changes relating to the Editor, Engine, and Gameplay Systems, 
							working on documentation for tools and workflows, and building and contributing to automated solutions employed by our own team to facilitate the process. <br />
							<br />
							This includes working on a complex Python script to perform Data Stripping Verification tasks,
							or providing heavy feedback for other internal tools that were instrumental in their design.<br />
							<br />
							I have proven an invaluable member of the team by exercising my bottomless hunger for knowledge,
							swiftly learning complex internal scripting languages and tools, which gave us a tangible boost in productivity.<br />
							<br />
							The work I have put into Larian will surely live on, and so will the work Larian has put into me.
