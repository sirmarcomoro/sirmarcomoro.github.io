							<h2>Hammerheart</h2>
						</header>
						<p> I started working on Hammerheart during its second year of development, a tough time. <br />
							The game needed an identity and help to get to Steam Early Access by the end of the next Summer. <br />
							<br />
							The game creatively blends 2D environments and scenery with 3D characters and gear, to achieve a look like no other.
							Set in England during the early 10th century, Hammerheart's main selling points are its maniacal historical accuracy and unique gameplay mechanics, 
							a mixture of real-time combat and slow-motion strategy that is sure to peak your interest, and then hook you.<br />
							<br />
							As part of a two man team, using Unity, I re-designed from scratch the Combat System, Equipment and Gear, UI, Controls, and AI. 
							I designed and built a host of small and big tools and systems for the game, and worked on it with my dear friend Bennett until it made it to Steam Early Access, 
							and I was hired by Larian Studios to work on Baldur's Gate 3.<br />
							<br />
							The reviews have been very positive since. A personal satisfaction: so many good words on the Combat System!
